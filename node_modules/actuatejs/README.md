# Actuate

> ac·tu·ate /ˈak(t)SHəˌwāt/ : cause (a machine or device) to operate.

A shiny new (~500b) vanilla implementation of what was previously [A tiny jQuery wrapper for animate.css](https://github.com/lukejacksonn/jquery-actuate) which allows for _one line easy_ actuation of CSS animation sequences with _thenable_ chaining.

Check out the [codepen examples](http://codepen.io/lukejacksonn/pen/dvaPPG).

## Getting Started

> Note: this library uses [promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) for which you [might need](http://caniuse.com/#feat=promises) a [polyfill](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/)

### Include the library
Directly in the `head` of your document from the CDN
```html
<script src='https://unpkg.com/actuatejs'></script>
```
or require it in your source files after `npm install actuatejs`
```js
import Actuate from 'actuatejs' // ES6
```

### Define a CSS animation
You can define your own or employ a library like [animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css)
```css
@keyframes pulse {
  from { transform: scale(1) }
  50% { transform: scale(1.05) }
  to { transform: scale(1) }
}
.pulse {
  animation-name: pulse;
}
```

### Run with javascript
In a script tag before the closing `body` tag
```js
Actuate('pulse')(document.body)
.then($ => console.log('Finished animating', $))
.catch($ => console.log($, 'was already animating'))
```

## Usage

The API is intended to be as simple as possible providing low overhead syntax for animation sequencing, chaining of sequences and `animationEnd` detection.

### Single Animation

To animate an HTML element, first pass the `actuate` function the name of the CSS `animation` you would like to apply. This primes the animation ready to be bound to a `target` element passed as the second argument:

```js
Actuate('tada')(document.body)
```

Once the function has received both arguments, the animation will be applied.

### Sequential Animations

Often it is desirable to run animations one after another. There is no native method that assists this behavior. The Actuate function accepts a space delimited list of named CSS animations as the first argument and handles this complexity for you:

```js
Actuate('rollIn tada rollOut')(document.body)
```

You can also pass in an array of named animations if you prefer:

```js
Actuate(['rollIn', 'tada', 'rollOut'])(document.body)
```

When one animation finishes the next one will start until there are no more to apply.

### Animation End

The actuate function returns a promise which means you can easily declare a `then` function which is guaranteed to execute once all the animations in a sequence have been applied.

```js
Actuate('tada fadeOut')(document.body)
.then($ => console.log('Finished Animating', $))
```

The `then` function gets passed the `target` element. In the above case `$ === document.body`.

### Already Animating

The only time the actuate with throw an _error_ is if you try animate an element that is already animating:

```js
addEventListener('click', () =>
  Actuate('tada')(document.body)
  .then($ => console.log('Finished'))
  .catch($ => console.log('Already Animating'))
)
```

### Chaining sequences

The actuate function takes advantage of [partial appliction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application) which means that animation sequences can be defined without having to immediately specify a `target` element.

```js
var intro = Actuate('rollIn')
var showoff = Actuate('bounce tada bounce')
var outro = Actuate('rollOut')
```

You can then provide a `target` element and let it flow through a chain of predefined animation sequences:

```js
Promise.resolve(document.body)
.then(intro)
.then(showoff)
.then(outro)
```
